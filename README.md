# verr - variadic errors


verr is a Go package created as a response to [github.com/pkg/errors](https://github.com/pkg/errors).
I like the overall idea and how it solves some of the important error handling problems, however, I find it a bit
limited and inconvenient for a flexible error handling in a way I want it to be. Thus, this package has been born
from [it](https://github.com/pkg/errors).

Any contributions are very welcome.
